        content="Welcome to Tolerance International. We exist to promote peace and fellowship and in doing so we must oppose fundamentalism and religious fanaticism wherever they appear. Islamic fanaticism is the most severe form of religious fanaticism that we are witnessing today, and through careful research we can trace the most important element in the spread of sectarian violence and terrorism under the banner of Islam to Iran. The Iranian people were the first Muslim nation to be hit by this plague, gladly they have been able to find the cure to combat it. TI is the first organization of its kind seeking to use this formula to oppose fanaticism and to educate those who are vulnerable. If, like us, you believe in a humane ordering of political and social life, you will want to support us. The following pages give a brief account of who we are and what we do. Please read them and get in touch., Tolerance International was set up to pioneer an all-inclusive approach to two pressing global issues facing our world today: global warming and extreme poverty. It is the first international NGO to have developed a strategy that combines efforts to combat climate change and to eradicate extreme poverty simultaneously. This is our Human &amp; Habitat (H&amp;H) Campaign" />
